## Dependencies

You'll need to install project requirements. I recommend creating a virtual environment. However you end up deciding to do this, the dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. 

If you install them using pip, I recommend running this command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Problem 1

Test files **must** be named `scenario1.csv` and `scenario2.csv`. Graph files will be output as described in the console output.

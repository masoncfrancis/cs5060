# CS 5060 - HW 2

## Requirements

This code requires `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib` to run. You may also need to install Tkinter to make 
sure that you can see the graphs. 

## Running the code

1. Make sure your dependencies are installed. You can install them using this command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. If you're using Tkinter to display the graphs, feel free to leave line `11` as is. Otherwise, comment it out.

3. Run the main file:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The program will output to the console which part of the assignement it is working on at applicable points in it's execution.
